\begin{abstract}
  A common assumption used when estimating geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) in a power system given a time series of nearby direct measurements or indirect estimates of the horizontal geoelectric field components $E_x(t)$ and $E_y(t)$ on Earth's surface is that the system is resistive.

\section{Introduction}

Geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) are electric currents in conducting systems that are due to electric fields near the Earth's surface. Time-varying electric and magnetic fields at Earth's surface are driven by time variations in ionospheric currents on time scales \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{on the order of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{of seconds to }\DIFaddend hours \citep{Ohtani2000} and the movement of Earth's surface relative to slow-varying current systems in Earth's ionosphere that are near stationary relative to the Sun \citep{Stening2013}. Of particular interest are currents induced in electric power systems because they can lead to system degradation, disruption, and failure \citep{Albertson1993,NERC2012,Gaunt2014}. Accurate estimation of GIC magnitudes is important for power system design, retrospective analysis, and mitigation of the impacts of space weather on power systems \citep{Molinski2002,Thomson2010,NERC2012,Gaunt2014}.

A common assumption made in estimates of GIC in an electric power system using either a measured or estimated time series of the horizontal geoelectric field at Earth's surface, $\mathbf{E}(t)$, is that the power system is resistive or quasi-DC in the sense that the relationship $GIC(t) = a_oE_x(t) + b_oE_y(t)$ holds \citep{Albertson1981,Lehtinen1985}. In this case, estimates of the coefficients $a_o$ and $b_o$ can be easily made from the data using linear regression when contemporaneous measurements of $GIC(t)$ and $\mathbf{E}(t)$ are available, or by using information about the connectivity of the power lines and values of the conductor and transformer resistances using DC circuit methods \citep[e.g.,][]{Boteler2014a,Boteler2014b,Boteler2017}. This quasi-DC assumption has been used or stated in many GIC-related works, for example, \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \citet{Pulkkinen2007,Wik2008,Pulkkinen2010,Ngwira2011,Horton2012,Viljanen2012,Overbye2012,Marshall2013,Liu2014,Zheng2014,Watari2015,Bonner2017}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \citet{Pulkkinen2007,Wik2008,Pirjola2009,Pulkkinen2010,Ngwira2011,Horton2012,Viljanen2012,Overbye2012,Marshall2013,Liu2014,Zheng2014,Watari2015}\DIFaddend .

%DIF < \cite{Oyedokun2013a} developed a method to account for the finite inductive response time of transformers by taking the GIC predicted based on the quasi-DC assumption and then applying a piecewise-linear L/R filter derived from bench-scale transformer measurements, with a time constant dependent on load, to obtain an alternative estimate of GIC.

\DIFdelend In this work, we use a unique dataset in which time series measurements of $\mathbf{E}$ and the surface horizontal geomagnetic field, $\mathbf{B}$, were made near a site where GIC was being measured in an electric power system.  We first estimate the system \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{parameters }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{coefficients }\DIFaddend $a_o$ and $b_o$ from data using conventional methods, in which they are modeled as frequency independent. Then, we use a model in which the system \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{parameters }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{coefficients }\DIFaddend are allowed to be frequency dependent, compute the frequency dependence, and compare this model's ability to represent GIC with the traditional frequency-independent model. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Two additional frequency-dependent models are considered that require only the geomagnetic field as an input and they are shown to be significantly better at estimating GIC than the models that use the geoelectric field as an input.

\section{Data}

The 1-second-cadence GIC data used span a total of 35 days across 10 intervals that start and end at midnight Japan Standard Time (JST) and are listed in Table~\ref{intervals}. These data have been presented previously in \citet{Watari2009} and \cite{Watari2015}. These time intervals are those for which GIC data was made available with the exception of three days for which there were obvious problems with either the electric field or GIC measurements. The GIC dataset includes 1~s raw data and 1~Hz low-pass-filtered raw measurements \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. The results presented here }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and the results presented }\DIFaddend are for the 1~Hz low-pass-filtered GIC measurements\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{.

Data for the time span of 2006-08-04T15:\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{00 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{00Z }\DIFaddend through 2006-08-08T15:\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{00 are shown }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{00Z are shown in }\DIFaddend Figure~\ref{sample}. The GIC data were provided as 1-day files that start at midnight JST and the times shown in Figure~\ref{sample} are Universal Time.

Spikes in the electric field measurements were assumed to be unphysical when the absolute value of a component $i$ of the electric field changed by more than 1~mV/km at time $t$, and the values $E_i(t-2)$ through $E_i(t+4)$ were replaced using linear interpolation of the values at $E_i(t-3)$ and $E_i(t + 5)$. In the sample shown in Figure~\ref{sample}, 21 spikes were identified in $E_x$ and zero in $E_y$. For \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{all of }\DIFdelend the time intervals considered, the fraction of interpolated electric field values ranged from 0--0.1\%.

The only modification made to the magnetic field measurements was the replacement of 36 data points on 2006-08-06 with linearly interpolated values. The 36 \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{values }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{data points }\DIFaddend for $B_x$ and $B_y$ \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{were the same and }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{have the same value and are }\DIFaddend much larger than the surrounding values.

The GIC data contains non-physical spikes that are followed by 40-80~s of anomalous values that appear as an exponential decay back to pre-spike values. These spikes were removed by identifying times $t$ when the change in the 1~s absolute value of $GIC(t)$ was greater than $0.05$~Amps and then values in a window $GIC(t-2)$ through $GIC(t+100)$ were replaced using a linear interpolation of the values at $GIC(t-3)$ and $GIC(t + 101)$. In the example interval shown in Figure~\ref{sample}, 493 spikes were removed \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. For all of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and approximately 15 spikes that were were not removed by the automated algorithm are still visible. For }\DIFaddend the time intervals considered, the fraction of interpolated GIC values ranged from 1--4\%.

the matrix equation $\underline{\mathbf{GIC}} = \underline{\mathbf{E}}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ is solved in a least squares sense, where $\underline{\mathbf{GIC}}$ is a zero mean 86400x1 matrix with rows of $GIC(t)$; $\mathbf{p} = [a_o,b_o]^T$, and $\underline{\mathbf{E}}$ is a 86400x2 matrix with rows of $[E_x(t), E_y(t)]$ with zero mean columns. The values of $a_o$ and $b_o$ determined in this way correspond to those that minimize the sum-of-squares of $GIC(t)-G_o(t)$ over a 1-day interval. \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \citep[][provided the mathematically equivalent closed-form equations for solving the matrix equation.]{Pulkkinen2007} %%%

\DIFadd{Motivated by the results described in the following section, in which Model~2 provides a significantly better representation of GIC than Model~1, we have also considered two additional models that can be used to estimate GIC. In these two models, a direct measurement of the geoelectric field is not used; instead, the driver is the geomagnetic field, which is much more often measured, and as a result, these models may be of practical interest}\DIFaddend .

In Model~3, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the parameters }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{previously computed coefficients }\DIFaddend $a(\omega)$ and $b(\omega)$ from Model~2 are used, but with an electric field $\mathbf{E}'$ computed using the measured magnetic field, $\mathbf{B}$, and a transfer function $\boldsymbol{Z}$: $\mathbf{E}'(\omega) \equiv \boldsymbol{Z}(\omega)\mathbf{B}(\omega)$ and

In this model, the transfer function components \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$z_x$ and $z_y$ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$z_x(\omega)$ and $z_y(\omega)$ }\DIFaddend are determined directly from measurements of $GIC(t)$ and $\mathbf{B}(t)$ and no electric field measurements are used; this model is expected to produce \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{predictions }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{estimates }\DIFaddend of GIC that are similar to that obtained from Model\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{~}\DIFaddend 3 because they both use the same input \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{variable}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{measurements}\DIFaddend .

Estimates of $a(\omega)$ and $b(\omega)$ \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in Model~2 }\DIFaddend are made at evaluation frequencies, $\omega_e \equiv 2\pi f_e$, by performing a ordinary least squares regression (OLS)\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{using Equation~\ref{model2} and }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{.

Following the suggestion of \cite{Simpson2005}, the 28 values of $f_e$ start at $0.25$ Hz and decrease by a factor of $\sqrt{2}$ and end at $1/43200$~Hz; if a $f_e$ value computed in this way is not an integer multiple of $1/86400$, the nearest smaller integer multiple is used. The \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{regression for each $f_e$ uses all DFT frequencies with values in a window with a width of twice the separation from the next lower value of $f_e$ and the given $f_e$ with the exceptions that the lowest evaluation window has a lower bound of $1/86400$~Hz and highest evaluation window has an upper bound of $0.5$~Hz}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{periods associated with the evaluation frequencies are listed in Table~\ref{evaluationperiods}}\DIFaddend .

The same approach is used for solving for \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$z_x$ and $z_y$ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$z_x(\omega_e)$ and $z_y(\omega_e)$ }\DIFaddend in Equation~\ref{model4}.
\DIFaddbegin 

\DIFaddend For the transfer function $\boldsymbol{Z}$ in $\mathbf{E}(\omega) = \boldsymbol{Z}(\omega)\mathbf{B}(\omega)$ used in Model~3, the $xx$ and $xy$ components of $\boldsymbol{Z}$ \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{at the evaluation frequencies }\DIFaddend are solved for using \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the same method used for Model~2 using the equation
}\DIFaddend 

\begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation*}
    E_x(\omega) = Z_{xx}(\omega)B_x(\omega) + Z_{xy}(\omega)B_{y}(\omega)

and the $yx$ and $yy$ components are solved for using

\begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation*}
    E_y(\omega) = Z_{yx}(\omega)B_x(\omega) + Z_{yy}(\omega)B_y(\omega)\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\,.

Transfer \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{function parameters }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{functions }\DIFaddend were computed for each of the \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{1-day }\DIFaddend segments.

The interpolated transfer function \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{parameters }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{coefficients }\DIFaddend were set to zero at frequencies higher than \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$0.25$}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$0.375$}\DIFaddend ~Hz and the transfer function estimate at $f=0$ was set to zero before interpolation.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Prediction }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GIC }\DIFaddend time series were calculated by \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{convolution }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{multiplication }\DIFaddend of the interpolated transfer function \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{parameters }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{coefficients }\DIFaddend with the DFT of the 24-hr long and 1~s cadence model inputs and computing the inverse DFT (e.g, for Model~2, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$G_E(f)=a^I(f)E_x(f)+b^I(f)E_y(f)$ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$G_E(\omega)=a^I(\omega)E_x(\omega)+b^I(\omega)E_y(\omega)$ }\DIFaddend was calculated, where the superscript $I$ indicates the interpolated value, and then the inverse DFT of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$G_E(f)$ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$G_E(\omega)$ }\DIFaddend was calculated to give the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{prediction }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{estimate of }\DIFaddend $G_E(t)$ on a 1~s time grid).

Several modifications to this basic procedure were considered.

When using these additional \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{steps }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{procedures }\DIFaddend individually, we find that the conclusions made regarding the differences \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in }\DIFaddend each model's prediction ability do not change because the differences in each model's prediction performance are within the calculated uncertainty of the used method.

\DIFaddend 

Out-of-sample \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{prediction }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{estimation quality }\DIFaddend metrics for each model on day $D$ were determined by computing the average model \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{parameters using the remaining }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{coefficients using the other }\DIFaddend 34 days of data and then using these \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{averaged parameters to generate a prediction }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{average coefficients to generate GIC }\DIFaddend time series and associated metrics on day $D$. This process was repeated to create a set of 35 out-of-sample prediction metrics for each model. In calculating the metrics, the first and last 10 minutes of the day were excluded to reduce the influence of transients that exist in the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{prediction }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{estimate }\DIFaddend at the start of the interval for the amount of time that the causal part of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{impulse response }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{transfer function impulse responses (computed by Fourier inversion of the interpolated transfer function components) }\DIFaddend is non-zero and at the end for the amount of time that the acausal part of the impulse \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{response is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{responses are }\DIFaddend non-zero.

The performance of each model in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{predicting }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{estimating }\DIFaddend GIC was assessed using three metrics: the prediction efficiency, PE, the mean-squared-error (MSE) ratio, and the signal-to-noise ratio \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(SN).
}

\DIFadd{The mean-squared-error for model $m$ is
}\begin{equation*}
  \DIFadd{\mbox{MSE}_m = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{t=t_o}^{t_f} \big(GIC(t)-GIC_m(t)\big)^2 \,,
}\end{equation*}
\noindent
\DIFadd{where $GIC_m(t)$ is the estimate from model $m$ at time step $t$;  $t_o=600$ and $t_f=85800$, so that sum is over one day of one-second-cadence measurements excluding the first and last 10~minutes. The MSE ratio for model $m$ is MSE$_1$/MSE$_m$}\DIFaddend .

The prediction efficiency, PE, is the ``Case I'' skill score described by \cite{Murphy1988} and is \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{defined as PE = 1 - variance(Prediction Error)/variance(Predicted); it }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{calculated using
}\begin{equation*}
  \DIFadd{\mbox{PE}_m = 1 - \frac{\sum_{t=t_o}^{t_f} \big(GIC(t)-GIC_m(t)\big)^2}{\sum_{t=t_o}^{t_f} \big(GIC(t)-\overline{GIC(t)}\big)^2}\,,
}\end{equation*}
\noindent
\DIFadd{where $\overline{GIC(t)}$ is an average over the same time interval used in the summations. The PE }\DIFaddend is a measure of the skill of the model \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{relative }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{with respect }\DIFaddend to the variance in the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{data that are predicted }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{predictand }\DIFaddend and it represents the fraction of the variance in the data that \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is }\DIFaddend predicted by the model \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(when PE~$\ge 0)$}\DIFaddend .

The average PE and \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the }\DIFaddend MSE ratios were computed by averaging the out-of-sample \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{PE }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{PEs }\DIFaddend and MSE ratios\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{; the average signal-to-noise ratio at a given frequency is the average of the out-of-sample signal-to-noise ratios at that frequency}\DIFdelend . The 95\% confidence interval, CI, on the PE and MSE \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{ratio was calculated using 1000 bootstrap samples of the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ratios were calculated using the bootstrap method }\citep{Zoubir1998}\DIFadd{: 1000 random samples (with replacement) of 17 of the 35 }\DIFaddend out-of-sample prediction metrics \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{.

\DIFadd{The frequency dependent signal-to-noise ratio for each 1-day segment }\DIFaddend at a given evaluation frequency \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is the ratio of of the smoothed power spectrum value of $GIC(\omega_e)$ to the smoothed power spectrum value of the prediction error at that evaluation frequency.

\DIFaddend The primary conclusions of this work follow from the results shown in Table~\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{1}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ref{resultstable}}\DIFaddend : the frequency dependent model, Model~2, is significantly better at \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{predicting }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{estimating }\DIFaddend GIC than the frequency independent model, Model~1; Model~3, which uses an estimate of the electric field based on magnetic field measurements, provides significantly better estimates of GIC than Model~2; Model~4, in which a transfer function that connects GIC to $\mathbf{B}$ was derived directly from the data, provides better estimates of GIC than Model~3.

To determine the statistical significance of the \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{PE }\DIFaddend differences, $10^5$ bootstrap averages of the segment PEs of each model were created and their differences were computed. From this, the null hypothesis that the PE of Model~2 is equal to that of Model~1 can be rejected at a significance level of less than $10^{-5}$ because no bootstrap average PE difference from Model~2 was found to be lower than that for Model~1. The null hypothesis that the PE of Model~3 is equal to that of Model~2 can also be rejected at the same significance level. The null hypothesis that the PE of Model~4 is equal to that of Model~3 can be rejected at a significance level of $10^{-2}$.

%DIF < Although inferior, the Model~1 does have a good prediction performance - the PE is 0.35 and the data/model correlation coefficient of 0.64. The top panel of  Figure~\ref{predictions} shows that its predicted GIC generally follows the overall trend of the measured GIC.
\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD <

\DIFdelend Figure~\ref{SN} shows the average signal-to-noise (i.e., signal to prediction error) ratios as a function of period for the four models. At each evaluation frequency, the SN ratio is the ratio of the average of the out-of-sample SN ratios \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{of the segments }\DIFdelend and the error bars represent a 95\% CIs based on 1000 bootstrap samples of the segment SN ratios. \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend Consistent with the results in Table~\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{1}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ref{resultstable}}\DIFaddend , the SN ratio for Model~1 is lower than that for Models~2-4 at all frequencies. However, ordering of the SN ratio for Models~2-4 is dependent on period.

Below $600$~s\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(10~min)}\DIFdelend , Model~2 has the largest SN ratio. This result is somewhat visible in the sample interval shown in Figure~\ref{predictions} where the high-frequency fluctuations in the prediction error for Model~2 are the smallest among the models. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{For these periods}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Below $600$~s}\DIFaddend , the predictive ability of each model is in the order that may be expected based on the data used to derive the model: Model~2, which uses direct measurements of the electric field, has a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{higher }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{larger }\DIFaddend SN ratio than Model~3, which uses an indirect estimate of the electric field. Model~4 has a slightly \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{higher }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{larger }\DIFaddend SN than Model~3, and this is expected because they both use the same input of the magnetic field, but Model~3 has an additional source of uncertainty from the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{parameters }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{data-estimated coefficients }\DIFaddend in $\mathbf{Z}$.

Above $600$~s, the ordering of the SN is not consistent with these expectations and is possibly explained by two factors: (1) \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the }\DIFaddend measured GIC is based on an integrated electric field along the power line, and the electric field used in Model~2 is a point measurement made 9~km away from the line - it follows that there is an implicit assumption in the model that the electric field is uniform over the length of the line on which GIC is measured; and (2) \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the }\DIFaddend error associated with this assumption has less of an influence on the errors in a model that uses \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the }\DIFdelend point measurements of the magnetic field. Issues related to this are discussed in the following section.

Above $10,000$~s (2.8~hrs), the SN ratio ordering is the same as the ordering of the PE and MSE ratios shown in Table~\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{1}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ref{resultstable}}\DIFaddend , with Model~1 having the lowest and Model~4 having the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{highest }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{largest }\DIFaddend SN ratio.

The average \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{parameters }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{coefficients }\DIFaddend and 95\% CI for Model 1 are \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$a_o = 73$ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$\overline{a}_o = 73.0$ }\DIFaddend $[62,83]$ A/(V/km) and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$b_o = -72.0$ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$\overline{b}_o = -72.0$ }\DIFaddend $[-98,-45]$ A/(V/km) and the distribution of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{parameters }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{coefficients }\DIFaddend for the segments is shown in Figure~\ref{histogram}. (Results are similar if 1-minute averages are used; \cite{Watari2015} found $a_o=38.1$ A/(V/km) and $b_o=-7.4$ A/(V/km) for the interval \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{2006-12-14--2006-12-15 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2006-12-14 to 2006-12-15 }\DIFaddend JST time interval). 

%DIF < However, for the data considered in this work, when a model $G(t) = $ $c_oB_x(t) + d_oB_y(t)$ is used, were $c_o$ and $d_o$ are constants, the in-sample average prediction efficiency is comparable to that of Model 1, but the out-of-sample prediction efficiency is negative.
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The values of $\overline{a}_o = 73$ A/(V/km) and $\overline{b}_o = -72$ A/(V/km) and Model~1 imply that for a given electric field magnitude, GIC is largest at the measurement site when the electric field points 45$^{\circ}$ west of north, which is approximately perpendicular to the 187~kV line shown in Figure~\ref{map} that runs in the northeast direction. \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

used magnetic field data at Memanbetsu and GIC data for a 3-day interval starting on 2005-12-26 and found a $b_o/a_o$ ratio of $-1.9/50$, corresponding to a maximum GIC when the electric field angle is 2$^{\circ}$ west of north; The $b_o/a_o = -7.4/38.1$ ratio documented in \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Watari2015} }%DIFAUXCMD

}

%DIF > The values of $a_o$ and $b_o$ are highly sensitive to the method number of points used in the regression. The values of $\overline{a}_o = 73$ A/(V/km) and $\overline{b}_o = -72$ A/(V/km) were found using 86400 points to compute 35 pairs of $a_o$ and $b_o$ values. If 864 points are used to compute 3500 pairs of $a_o$ and $b_o$ values, $\overline{a}_o=+25.7$ and $\overline{b}_o=+15.2$ A/(V/km) and Model~1 predicts maximum GIC when the electric field is approximately 30 degrees east of north, in the approximate direction of the 187 kV line. 

%DIF > However, as shown in Figure~\ref{map}, the 187 kV line which terminates at the Memanbetsu substation runs in the northeast direction, and hence the dominant contribution to the measured GIC is expected be from currents flowing in this line. If the electric field is the same at all points on the line, GIC in the grounded transformers at Memanbetsu substation should be the largest when the electric field points in the northeast direction.
\DIFaddend 

The average \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{parameters }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{coefficients }\DIFaddend for Models~2 and~4 are shown in Figure~\ref{Z}--\ref{Phi}. The error bars at each \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{time step or period is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{period correspond to }\DIFaddend the standard error of the 35 values used to compute the average.

%DIF < Figure~\ref{H} shows that the timescale of variations of an impulse in $\mathbf{E}$ for Model~2 and $\mathbf{B}$ for Model~4 are similar and are different from zero at more than one time value (the impulse response for Model~3 is similar to that of Model~2 and is not shown). By definition, the impulse response for Model~1 is zero except at $t=0$. Note that the sign of the $E_y$ impulse response at $t=0$ for Model~1 is opposite that for Model~2 (at $t=0$, $b_o < 0$ while $h_b(t=0)>0$). (An explanation for the acausality of the impulse response is given in \cite{Egbert1992,Kelbert2017}).
\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend Figure~\ref{Z} shows that the frequency domain transfer functions for Model~2 vary by an order of magnitude on timescales of 60~s to 12~h (that for Model~1 is constant by definition). For this system, GIC \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is }\DIFaddend more sensitive to $E_y$ than $E_x$ due to $b(\omega) > a(\omega)$, but \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{note that }\DIFdelend $E_y(t)$ has less variability than $E_x(t)$ - the variance in $E_x(t)$ is $\sim$5x larger than $E_y(t)$ over the entire dataset (this is also visible in Figure~\ref{sample}). 

The ratio of $|\overline{b}_o|/|\overline{a}_o|$ is approximately 1 for Model~1 and this can be compared with $|b(\omega)|/|a(\omega)|$ calculated using the lines for $|a(\omega)|$ and $|b(\omega)|$ shown in Figure~\ref{Z}. The ratio varies from 2.7 at $T=30$~s to 1.6 at $T=12$~h. 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{At $T=12$~h, the highest period considered, the phases of $a(\omega)$ and $b(\omega)$ shown in Figure~\ref{Phi} differ by 180 degrees and the signs are consistent with those of $\overline{a}_o$ and $\overline{b}_o$.

\DIFadd{Both Model~1 and~2 predict a maximum GIC when the electric field angle is significantly different from the angle of the 187~kV line.

\section{Discussion}
\DIFaddbegin \label{discussion}
\DIFaddend 

There are at least three possible explanations a frequency dependence in data-derived system \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{parameters}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{coefficients}\DIFaddend : (1) the quasi-DC approximation is invalid, (2) it is an artifact of the measurement process, and (3) the electric field is not spatially and spectrally constant across the region of the power system.

(1) When the quasi-DC approximation is used, \cite{Albertson1981} is usually cited; their justification for the quasi-DC approximation is given in an Appendix as ``An analysis based on Carson's equations reveals that transmission lines can be modeled for GIC determination by using their positive sequence resistance values with a small correction factor to account for skin and proximity effects. The correction factor varies from 0.95 to 1.0 depending on conductor size.'' (Carson's equations are equations for the impedance associated with a wire above an infinite and uniform half-space conducting slab [\cite{Carson1926,Grigsby2007}] \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and positive sequence resistance values are the per phase line resistances in a balanced 3-phase power system}\DIFaddend .)

\cite{Lehtinen1985} justifies the use of the quasi-DC approximation using the argument that GIC amplitudes are significant at frequencies that are much lower than the 50~Hz power line frequency. Clarified, this is essentially a statement that the reactance is proportional to frequency and although the reactance is typically $\sim$5 times larger than the resistance at 50~Hz \citep{Purchala2005}, the reactance will be $\sim$10 times smaller or less than the resistance at GIC frequencies of $\sim$1~Hz and lower. Given these arguments, the quasi-DC approximation is justified, and an explanation involving a violation of the assumption of a uniform half-space conducting slab Earth using a conductivity that varies with depth \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{to more accurately model skin an proximity effects }\DIFaddend also seems unlikely to explain the results as it would need to account for at least an order of magnitude of reactance. (However, \cite{Boteler1994} noted that for certain systems, the $L/R$ time constant \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{of the power network }\DIFaddend may be large enough to warrant inclusion in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{DC }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GIC }\DIFaddend flow calculations; this topic has more recently been pursued by \cite{Oyedokun2013a}.)

(2) A second consideration is that artifacts of the electric field and GIC measurements used in Model~2 cause the observed frequency dependence. However, the GIC instrument (HIOKI 9279 current sensor) is frequency independent to within $\pm 0.2$\% in this period range and the response characteristics of the magnetic and electric field instruments are essentially frequency independent relative to the observed transfer function frequency dependence for periods in the range of $30-10^{5}$~s (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Oowada et al. 1998, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

The exact calculation of GICs in a power system under the quasi-DC assumption requires knowledge of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{earth potential at the grounding }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{electric field at all }\DIFaddend points of the system, and simulations of GIC flow \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \citep{Albertson1981,Lehtinen1985} %%%
\DIFdelend typically start with an assumed electric field along the lines to calculate \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{these potential differences. The potential differences }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{input voltages }\citep{Albertson1981,Lehtinen1985, Pirjola2009}\DIFadd{. The electric fields }\DIFaddend are then used along with the DC system component resistances and their connectivity to calculate GIC in the different parts of the system. In both Model~1 and Model~2, the input electric field is \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{typically }\DIFaddend assumed to be spatially uniform along the line in which GIC was measured so that the potential difference is directly proportional to the electric field. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{If it is not, the parameters derived from the data }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Spatial variations in the electric field measured on Earth's surface can be due to horizontal variations in the incident electric field and horizontal variations in sub-surface conductivity, including those at land-ocean interfaces. If a spatial variation exists along the line in which GIC was measured, the coefficients derived from measurements }\DIFaddend in both models may differ significantly from those calculated using system configuration and resistance information. However, the data-derived \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{parameters }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{coefficients }\DIFaddend will not have a frequency dependence that results \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{from a }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{only from the }\DIFaddend variation in the direction of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a static }\DIFaddend electric field along the line.

The second assumption of Model~1 is that the spectrum of the electric field is uniform. Violation of this assumption can lead to an apparent violation of the quasi-static approximation. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Suppose the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Consider an }\DIFaddend electric field and GIC \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{that }\DIFaddend are measured at one end of a long line segment \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{with }\DIFaddend the electric field \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{being }\DIFaddend non-zero only at a frequency of $\omega_1$. If the electric field is spectrally uniform along the full line segment, then from the quasi-static approximation it follows that the measured GIC will also only be non-zero at a frequency of $\omega_1$. If the electric field \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{on the far half }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{at the other end }\DIFaddend of the line is non-zero only at a frequency of $\omega_2$, the observed GIC and electric field will appear to be inconsistent with the quasi-static approximation because GIC will have non-zero variations at both $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$.

To test the effect of different points on the line having different electric field spectra on the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{parameter }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{coefficient }\DIFaddend estimates, we created a simulated GIC signal using electric field measurements made in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Memambetsu }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Memanbetsu }\DIFaddend (indicated with a superscript M) and Kakioka (superscript K), Japan:

\begin{equation}
  G_s(t)=a_o\big[(1-r)E^{\mbox{\tiny M}}_x(t) + rE^{\mbox{\tiny K}}_x(t)\big]+b_o\big[(1-r)E^{\mbox{\tiny M}}_y(t) + rE^{\mbox{\tiny K}}_y(t)\big]
\end{equation}

\noindent
with $a_o=1$, $b_o=-1$ and $r=0.2$. $G_s$ represents a simulated GIC in which 20\% of the line has a different electric field. (The zero-lag cross correlation is -0.40 for $E^{\mbox{\tiny M}}_x(t)$ and $E^{\mbox{\tiny K}}_x(t)$ and 0.64 for $E^{\mbox{\tiny M}}_y(t)$ and $E^{\mbox{\tiny K}}_y(t)$). The model equation
\begin{equation}
  G_s(\omega)=a(\omega)E^{\mbox{\tiny M}}_x(\omega)+b(\omega)E^{\mbox{\tiny M}}_y(\omega)
\end{equation}
\noindent
was then used to compute $a(\omega)$ and $b(\omega)$ and they were both found to exhibit a frequency dependence similar to that shown in Figure~\ref{Z} in that they both have an increase in magnitude with period, although in this experiment the increase was a factor 2-6 for periods in the range of $2$~s to $12$~hr.

Although this proof-of-concept simulation shows how variations in the frequency content of the geoelectric field on the line in which GIC is measured can cause the data-estimated system \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{parameters }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{coefficients }\DIFaddend to have a frequency dependence, it is very crude as it uses several approximations that were necessitated by \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{data availability }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the availability of data}\DIFaddend . The distance from Kakioka to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Memambetsu }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Memanbetsu }\DIFaddend is $\sim$1400~km, which is $\sim$14x that of the length of the power line ($\sim$100~km) on which GIC was measured, and the correlations between the electric field from the two sites are likely to be lower than the fields measured at points separated by a distance closer to the length of the power line. In addition, the discontinuous change in the electric field implicit in the model implies that there would be a part of the line that can have a non-zero net charge and thus is not physically realizable for typical conductors. A more realistic simulation would use electric field measurements that were both near a line on which GIC was measured and separated from each other by a distance that is comparable to the length of the line.

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
%DIF < The violation of the spectral uniformity assumption may contribute to the explanation of the finding that Model~4 provides significantly better estimates of GIC than Model~1. On average, the magnetic field is more uniform spectrally than the electric field and so the parameters of Model~4 may be capturing both an MT response and spectral averaging effect.
%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
%DIF < This explanation may also explain the finding that Model 4 provides significantly better predictions than Model 2 at long periods (but not at short periods). The magnetic field spectra typically exhibit significantly less spatial variability so the computed model parameters are able to capture a spatial averaging effect in addition to the effect of the ground impedance. 
%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
%DIF < One way to test this hypothesis is to consider time intervals in which the spatial variability in the spectra of $\mathbf{E}$ is low -- the frequency dependence of $a(\omega)$ and $b(\omega)$ should be less than average. The frequency dependence of $a(\omega)$ and $b(\omega)$ should depend on the average spatial gradient in $\mathbf{E}_x(\omega)$ and $\mathbf{E}_y(\omega)$, respectively. (A reasonable test of this is not possible with this dataset because the nearest electric field instrument is $\sim$10x farther away from MMB, in Kakioka, Japan, than the length of the power line on which GIC was measured.)
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{In the discussion of (3) above, we have attempted to address independently the contribution of spatial variations in the electric field magnitude and direction and spatial variations in the electric field spectra, but generally these variations do not occur independently as they are both caused by horizontal variations in the ground conductivity. A time-varying ionospheric current can also cause spatial and spectral variations in the electric field magnitude }\citep{Boteler1998}\DIFadd{. Thus, the finding in Section~\ref{results} that the angle of the electric field that produces maximum GIC differs significantly from the angle of the 187~kV power line for both Model~1 and Model~2 may be consistent with the frequency dependence of $a$ and $b$ found in Model~2. However, testing this claim would require a full network analysis, knowledge of the ground conductivity throughout the network, and accounting for the driving ionospheric currents.

\section{Conclusions}

The primary implications of the results presented are (1) significantly improved \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{predictions }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{estimates }\DIFaddend of GICs using data-derived system \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{parameters }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{coefficients }\DIFaddend $a$ and $b$ can be made if they are allowed to be frequency dependent and (2) a direct comparison of data-derived $a$ and $b$ \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{parameters }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{coefficients }\DIFaddend and those computed using power system configuration information will be problematic if the data are not consistent with the assumptions of Equation~\ref{model1}.

Although the use of frequency independent $a$ and $b$ \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{parameter values }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{coefficients }\DIFaddend estimated from data give a reasonable \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{out-of-sample prediction model}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{estimates of GIC}\DIFaddend , it is not known how much data-estimated \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{parameter }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{coefficient }\DIFaddend values will differ from those directly calculated. (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Because the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Due to the limited availability of }\DIFaddend details of the power system \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{under consideration in this work are not available}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and the ground conductivity along the line}\DIFaddend , we were not able to make this comparison.) Works that use Model~1 and generally note a high degree of visual consistency between the measured values and predictions using this model (e.g., the top panel of Figure~\ref{predictions}). However, we have shown using \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a data set of }\DIFdelend contemporaneous GIC and electric field measurements that a significantly better estimation of GIC can be obtained by using a frequency dependent model of the form of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Model~2.

%The out-of-sample prediction quality reported here for Model~1 (a PE of 0.35 and CC of 0.64). If only a few days of data are used for their estimation, the out-of-sample prediction quality using all data is very poor due to the high degree of uncertainty of in their estimates \todo{Give example}. As a result, predictions of GIC using Model~1 in the literature using only a few days of data are expected to be significantly worse if out-of-sample predictions had been used.

When GIC and magnetic field measurements are available, a model of the form of Model~4 can be used. For this particular data set, we have found that such a model provides the best estimates of GIC in terms of the PE\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and MSE}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, MSE, and signal-to-error }\DIFaddend metrics. Local ground magnetic field estimates along with GIC measurements could be used to derive a transfer function model that is updated when the system configuration changes and this model could be used to estimate GIC under extreme or simulated geomagnetic conditions. A key advantage of this approach is that long-term geomagnetic field measurements are generally easier to make and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{are }\DIFdelend more readily available \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{than geoelectric field measurements}\DIFaddend . A disadvantage is the transfer function \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{parameters }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{coefficients of Model~4 }\DIFaddend are difficult to interpret physically because they contain components of the transfer functions that connect the electric field to the magnetic field and GIC to the electric field\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and frequency-dependent artifacts due to violations of the assumption that the field is spectrally uniform}\DIFdelend .

%DIF < Based on the results in this work, the model of the form $GIC(t)$ $=a_oE_x(t)+b_oE_y(t)$, where the electric field is either measured or estimated using a transfer function at a given point near where GIC was measured, should be regarded as an approximation similar to that assumed when an equation of the form $GIC(t)$ $=c_oB_x(t)+d_oB_y(t)$ or $GIC(t)$ $=c_odB_x(t)/dt+d_odB_y(t)/dt$ is used, where $a_o, b_o, c_o, $and $d_o$ are constants (e.g., {\color{red} \textbf{[REFS]}}).

Because the details of the power system under consideration in this work are not available, we were not able to make this comparison. Note that frequency independent system parameters calculated using the approach in this work may not be directly comparable to those found from a network analysis for several reasons: (1) At periods less than $\sim 30$~s, the signal-to-noise ratio is low and the parameter estimates are expected to be biased; as shown in the Appendix, the transfer function estimates are highly sensitive to the method used for their calculation at (2) Also at periods less than $\sim 30$~s, effects of the instrument response may be significant. \cite{Fujii2015} has noted that the 1-s geoelectric field data from the Memambetsu Observatory were low-pass filtered with a 3.3-s cutoff-period prior to 2010; (3) The GIC observed in a power system is based on the integration of the electric field along a power line. All of the models assume that the electric field is constant along the line where the GIC is measured, but many works have shown that the electric field is expected to have variations on length scales comparable to the line considered ($\sim$100~km). \todo{REFS}
